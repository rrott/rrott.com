about:
  - "It is a grunt plugin inspired by Sprockets to compile CoffeeScripts that has sprockets-style comments to indicate dependencies. It allows web developers in their CoffeeScript files to write Sprockets-style comments to indicate dependencies, e.g. </p><div class='bold'>#= require main<br>#= require_tree lib</div><p>"
  - "This ruby gem is written in CoffeeScript but it compiles itself to JavaScript using the previous version of itself."
