# How to stop worrying and start using Sketch =)

> *SVG is an image format for vector graphics. It literally means Scalable Vector Graphics.*
...okay

**Preamble:** I am a developer who hates working with such huge graphic editors as Photoshop, GIMP or Illustrator. It's a problem cause from one hand I am a perfectionist who loves making perfect websites but on another hand I'm too lazy to spend a lot of time learning tons of information on how to use these image editors =(

I've been using SVG since IE9, and even I had a lot of problem with supporting it, I faced much more problems creating or editing SVG images. The worst moments of my life were when I had to update **"a bit"** an SVG image... Each time I tried to find a really good vector graphic editor but with no success... till I tried **Sketch 3**!
Honestly, I love it!

When I started working on my website, I've got an idea about creating a small logo or something to describe who am I and what I do.

###I leave it up in Ukraine; I love my country,  and know what? I've got an idea that is a simple as that:
>**What if I put Ukrainian emblem into the ruby logo?**

<img class='responsive' title="Ruby-Logo-Idea", alt="Ruby-Logo-Idea", src="/images/blog/sketch-svg-ruby-logo/logo-ideas.png" ></img>

#### And after several days of painting, I finished with the following result:


|<img class='responsive' title="Ruby-Logo-ukraine", alt="Ruby-Logo-ukraine", src="/images/rrott-ruby-logo-ukraine.svg"/>|<img class='responsive' title="Ruby-Logo", alt="Ruby-Logo", src="/images/rrott-ruby-logo.svg"/>|
|---|---|
At the moment, my less hated editor was Gimp, so I started working with it but got stuck right away... I spent a day for nothing and have got an ugly not-scalable picture that looked like big red blot =(

I knew about Sketch and tried it a year ago, but it was too simple for its price and I abandoned the idea of using it... till now. I gave it a chance once again, and it made my day!

Above is how it looked like:

  <img class='blog-image', data-index="0", alt="Ruby-Logo-Idea", src="/images/blog/sketch-svg-ruby-logo/sketch-with-grids.png"/>
</a>

<a href="/images/blog/sketch-svg-ruby-logo/sketch-with-rulles.png", title="Ruby-Logo-Idea">
  <img class='blog-image', data-index="1" alt="Ruby-Logo-Idea", src="/images/blog/sketch-svg-ruby-logo/sketch-with-rulles.png"/>
</a>

<a href="/images/blog/sketch-svg-ruby-logo/transparent-emblem-of-ukraine.png", title="Ruby-Logo-Idea">
  <img class='blog-image', data-index="2", alt="Ruby-Logo-Idea", src="/images/blog/sketch-svg-ruby-logo/transparent-emblem-of-ukraine.png"/>
</a>

<a href="/images/blog/sketch-svg-ruby-logo/emblem-of-ukraine.png", title="Ruby-Logo-Idea">
  <img class='blog-image', data-index="3", alt="Ruby-Logo-Idea", src="/images/blog/sketch-svg-ruby-logo/emblem-of-ukraine.png"/>
</a>

<a href="/images/blog/sketch-svg-ruby-logo/collored-emblem-of-ukraine.png", title="Ruby-Logo-Idea">
  <img class='blog-image', data-index="4", alt="Ruby-Logo-Idea", src="/images/blog/sketch-svg-ruby-logo/collored-emblem-of-ukraine.png"/>
</a>

It's smart and simple, is not it?

##So what?
I am going to publish several additional blog posts about using svg and (probably) Sketch.

You can follow this topic here: [SVG category](/blog/svg/)
And here is my first post about [Bug with CSS transition animation in Safari](/blog/svg/issue-with-css-transition-animation-in-safari.html)
